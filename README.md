As I've been busy learning the MEAN stack with the Coursera Web Development course, I decided to build this little weather app using AngularJS, SCSS and HTML.

I used two APIs: [The Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) and [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start). For REST calls, I used ng-resource which I've found to be quite efficient.

For the UI, I chose a clean, minimal and responsive design with colors inspired by Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom. Icons are by [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/).

I find my code to be in some kind of callback hell but at least it works? :) Since I'm still learning to be a better at JS, I would love any kind of feedback or advice on how to improve.

The requirements for this project are as follows:

* Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
* Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
  * User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.
  * User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
  * User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
